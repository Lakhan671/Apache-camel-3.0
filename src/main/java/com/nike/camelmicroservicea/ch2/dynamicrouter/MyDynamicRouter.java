     * to pass parts of the Camel Exchange to the method for processing. This can

     * code for extracting the relative data from the Exchange.

     * This implementation stores an int property with the message exchange that is
     * used to drive the routing behavior. This method will be called from multiple
     * threads, one per message, so storing message specific state as a property is
     * a good strategy.
